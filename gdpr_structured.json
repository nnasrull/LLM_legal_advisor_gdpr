      "title": "Principles Article 5 Principles relating to processing of personal data 1. Personal data shall be: (a) processed lawfully , fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’); (b) collect ed for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompati ble with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or histo rical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompat ible with the initial purposes (‘pur pose limitation’); (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessar y in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’); (d) accurate and, where necessar y, kept up to date ; ever y reasonable step must be take n to ensure that personal data that are inaccurat e, having regar d to the purposes for whic h they are processed, are erased or rectifi ed without dela y (‘accuracy’); 4.5.2016 L 119/35 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN (1)Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1). (e) kept in a form which permits identif ication of data subjects for no long er than is necessar y for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insof ar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or histor ical researc h purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropr iate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (‘stor age limitation’); (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropr iate secur ity of the personal data, including prot ection against unauthor ised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destr uction or damage , using appropr iate technical or organisational measures (‘integri ty and confidentiality’). 2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’). Article 6 Lawfulness of processing 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; (b) processing is necessar y for the perf ormance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract ; (c) processing is necessar y for compliance with a legal oblig ation to which the controller is subject ; (d) processing is necessar y in order to prot ect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; (e) processing is necessar y for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public inter est or in the exer cise of official author ity vested in the controller ; (f) processing is necessar y for the purposes of the legitimate inter ests pursued by the controller or by a third party, excep t where such inter ests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require prot ection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public author ities in the performa nce of their task s. 2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specifi c provisions to adap t the application of the rules of this Regulation with regar d to processing for compl iance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapt er IX. 3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by: (a) Union law; or (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject. The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that lega l basis or, as rega rds the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessar y for the performa nce of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official author ity vested in the controller . That legal basis may contain specifi c provisions to adap t the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data whic h are subject to the processing; the data subjects concer ned; the entities to, and the purposes for whic h, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storag e periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specifi c 4.5.2016 L 119/36 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN processing situations as provided for in Chapt er IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be propor tionate to the legitimate aim pursued. 4.

Article 7 Conditions for consent 1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consente d to processing of his or her personal data. 2. If the data subject's consent is given in the conte xt of a written declaration which also concer ns other matt ers, the request for consent shall be present ed in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matt ers, in an intelli gible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language . Any part of such a declaration whic h constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. 3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdra wal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdra w as to give consent. 4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be take n of whether , inter alia, the performa nce of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessar y for the performance of that contract. Article 8 Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to informa tion society services 1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is belo w the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or author ised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not belo w 13 years. 4.5.2016 L 119/37 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN 2. The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or author ised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology . 3.
